# Vizro integration 

The project is a simple demonstration of how you can use the [Vizro](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool for fast and well-controlled data visualization inside a Data Science project made in Python. A well-implemented integration of Vizro functionality can be a powerful tool in the rapid presentation of the most important information about the data, custom transformations performed on the data, or the results of the model. And the whole visualization is presented in the form of a nice-looking dashboard which is basically a simple web application.
